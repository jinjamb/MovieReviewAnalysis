it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy philipps alongside with erika christensen and victor garberwhom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves

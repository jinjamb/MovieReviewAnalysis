when i was told of this movie i thought it would be another chick flick i was wrong this movie sends a powerful message about judging others i was deeply moved everyone i have encountered i have recommended this movie to no one has come back saying it was bad busy also did a great job with her role in this film i dont know much about her acting career but wow they way she pulled off the end of this fill was great at the beginning it was a little slow but after she went to the hospitalwow the movie picks up again i have no idea why this movie hasnt been spoken of in the movie world my wish would be for this movie to be released again and advertised morebecause it sends a powerful message in a mere hour and a half

what a fun movie if youre a giallo fan red queen kills 7 times is a real winner to begin with its hard to go wrong with barbara bouchet and marina malfatti in the same giallo both are wonderful especially the wideeyed innocent bouchet as the guilt ridden woman fearing for her life the kill scenes in red queen kills 7 times are especially nice and feature enough blood to make most fans happy one of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and really gets the movie off to a good start the killer the red queen is one of the most overthetop and interesting looking murderers ive seen in an italian movie the 70s sets and fashions are wonderful in fact all the visuals are interesting with the laughing red queen running across the bridge at night being one of my favorite moments in the film the convoluted plot held my interest throughout finally bruno nicolais score may be the best ive heard from the composer the main theme is so memorable i havent been able to get it out of my head for two days the only two issues i have with red queen kills 7 times come in the films finale first the person responsible for the murders is far too easy to spot if youve seen more than a couple gialli you wont have any problem determining who is behind the killings second the ending feels a little too rushed and as a result is a bit confusing im definitely not one who needs every plot point spelled out to me but ill admit to being at a loss to explain it all a second viewing might just clear this up

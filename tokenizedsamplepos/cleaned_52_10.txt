this movie is incredible if you have the chance watch it although a warning youll cry your eyes out i do every time i see it and i own it and have watched it many times the performances are outstanding it deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope this movie made me look at the world differently vicarious experience according to my english teacher also if youve seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light home room is a phenomenal movie and i rate it 1010 for real because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heartwrenching dialogue very tense very moving doesnt give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind

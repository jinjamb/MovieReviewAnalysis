i liked this movie a lot it really intrigued me how deanna and alicia became friends over such a tragedy alicia was just a troubled soul and deanna was so happy just to see someone after being shot my only complaint was that in the beginning it was kind of slow and it took awhile to get to the basis of things other than that it was great

home room like zero day and elephant was inspired by the recent wave of school shootings but unlike the other two films home room focuses on two survivors not the shooters or those killed in the aftermath of a shooting making it less exploitive and more useful because little effort is wasted in asking questions for which there are no answers dont give up on this little film during the first 20 minutes it is supposed to set up the real story but plays like a rejected hill street blues episode it is lame but bear with it at least it pads the running length enough to get the film classified as a feature i recommend skipping this entirely and just jumping ahead to the hospital scenesthere is nothing here that you cant pick up from the remainder of the film like a lot of good little films this was creatively a oneman show as paul f ryan was both the writer and the director while this arrangement does not guarantee a good film it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in big budget dramatic features because the script of home room is its real strength it is fortunate that the writer also executed the production and insured that his vision made it onto the screen ryan takes a huge chance with the ending which tests the limits of the average viewers sentimentality tolerance he runs it right up to the edge but against all logic leaves you crying instead of cringing why the ending works is some combination of the audience need for a reward at the end of this kind of journey the song sarah mclaughlins sweet surrender he goes out on and the amazing editing of the final minute the other strength of the film is the casting of busy phillips alicia and erika christensen deanna as the main protagonists although phillips plays her standard alienated surly teen and christensen her intelligent daughter of a good family they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before the family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to ryan what is happening here is all about the two of them despite a lame side story about a police detective wondering around town trying to tie alicia to the lone shooter if they ever recut and trim the film this side story should be condensed a story about two extremely disparate girls bonding and helping each other is hardly a novel idea and ryan could have easily steered this film into clichã© and predictability but instead his script has them engaging in a fascinating and convincing sparring match slowly chipping away at each other and sharing moments of vulnerability only to retreat back inside themselves deannas im dying inside line just tears you aparti cant think of a moment in any other film that i felt as intensely as that one she desperately needs a connection that alicia just as desperately resists deanna only makes progress when she retreats the viewer keeps expecting the group hug that never seems to happen ultimately this not only generates a lot of suspense but leaves you admiring both characters and the two actresses who brought them to life then again what do i know im only a child

when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen figurine i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these quibbles apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno nicolai score he may not be morricone but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of sexiness some gory kills and minimal police interference super

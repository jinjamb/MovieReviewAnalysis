while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem i dont know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle thrown together by fate they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring but all in all a excellent movie

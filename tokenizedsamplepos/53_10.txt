home room really surprised me in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town the movie focus on two opposite characters aleciabusy phillips and deannaerika christensen alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting she seems to show no emotion about it deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends very much in the style of the breakfast club home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone

my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my interest i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an antisocial goth this was probably why my shirt was soaked because ive experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling i too would not have sought out this movie but im sure glad i saw it very moving very touching great for those who love a good drama or tearjerker

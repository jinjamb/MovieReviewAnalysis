emilio miraglias first giallo feature the night evelyn came out of the grave was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror and this second film is even better weve got more of the giallo side of the equation this time around although miraglia doesnt lose the gothic horror stylings that made the earlier film such a delight miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot this time around and as a result its the typical giallo labyrinth with characters all over the place and red herrings being thrown in every few minutes this is a definite bonus for the film however as while it can get a little too confusing at times theres always enough to hold the audiences interest and miraglias storytelling has improved since his earlier movie the plot opens with a scene that sees two young girls fighting before their grandfather explains to them the legend behind a rather lurid painting in their castle the legend revolves around a woman called the red queen who legend has it returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people a few years later murders begin to occur even though he only made two giallos miraglia does have his own set of tributes its obvious that the colour red is important to him as it features heavily in both films and he appears to have something against women called evelyn he likes castles gothic atmospheres and stylish murders too which is fine by me miraglia may be no argento when it comes to spilling blood but he certainly knows how to drop an over the top murder into his film and here we have delights involving a volkswagen beetle and a death on an iron fence that is one of my all time favourite giallo death scenes the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfatti heading up an eyepleasing cast of ladies that arent afraid to take their clothes off the score courtesy of bruno nicolai is catchy and even though it doesnt feature much of the psychedelic rock heard in the night evelyn came out of the grave it fits the film well the ending is something of a turnoff as although miraglia revs up the gothic atmosphere it comes across as being more than a little bit rushed and the identity of the murderer is too obvious but even so this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that i highly recommend to fans of the genre

i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the tv and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyones life i give it a 10 more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didnt even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see

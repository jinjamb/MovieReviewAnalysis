at first i wasnt sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephant once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses ive just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it i couldnt even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic busy phillips acting is off the chain that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles

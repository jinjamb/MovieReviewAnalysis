this is one of the most amazing stories i have ever seen if this film had been directed by larry clark then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place instead the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it effected the victims who survived i had seen busy phillips in other films before but her performance in this movie is by far her best the only other movie that ive seen with erika christensen is swim fan which made me almost not want to watch this film but she turned in a very good performance herself this is one of the few movies i have seen that was actually able to make me cry trust me when i tell you that doesnt happen very often home room is a beautiful film and thats all there is too it

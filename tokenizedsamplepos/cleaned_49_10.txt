if you get it its magnificent if you dont its decent please understand that getting it does not necessarily mean youve gone through a school shooting there is so much more to this movie that at times the school shooting becomes insignificant above all its a movie about acceptance both superficiallyof a traumatic event but also of people who are different for whatever reason its also a movie about unendurable pain and how different people endure it in this case the contrast between alicias rage and deannas obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat thankfully the audience is given credit for being human beings our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy implausibly moralistic ending above and beyond that i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that yet i must admit i cried like a lost little baby during this movie there were certain things about it that hit very close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed but that is not necessarily a bad thing

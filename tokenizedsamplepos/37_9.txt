of the elements that make this the best at this point i have to say 1 is christine mcintire shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent i imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemps possibly dying another character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goofball hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or for that matter anywhere i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when a short is this good whos going to complain not i

this interesting giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling plot and a really sadistic killer that obviously likes to hunt his victims down before murdering them in gory ways directed by emilio p miraglia who one year earlier also made the very interesting la notte che evelyn usci della tomba see also my comment on that one the film starts off a little slow but all in all no time is wasted with unnecessary sub plots or sequences this film is a germanitalian coproduction but it was released in germany on video only in a version trimmed by 15 minutes of plot under the stupid title horror house at least the murder scenes which will satisfy every gorehound are fully intact and the viewer still gets the killers motive at the end but the italian version containing all the footage is still the one to look for of course a convincing giallo with obligatory twists and red herrings la dama rossa uccide sette volte is highly recommended to giallo fans and slightly superior to miraglias above mentioned other thriller

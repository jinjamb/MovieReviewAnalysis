i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywoodnot very bignames in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i tought we turks really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heisthostage movie genre but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinkingagain how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answerby hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produceor vice versa i dont have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesnt give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again

what was with all the turkish actors no offense but i thought it was all for nothing for all these actors the film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability it demanded next to nothing i bought this film to see michael madsen he is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him the script was so bad their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didnt even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish it was really weird and they didnt sound like real guns a video game had better sound effects than this film there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang he had this american whining voice like a girl shouting lines like lets get the fk out of here and what are we going to do man he sounded like a girl as a positive it was funny to watch and it made me laugh too for a few seconds whoo hoo dumb film poor madsen he will bounce back

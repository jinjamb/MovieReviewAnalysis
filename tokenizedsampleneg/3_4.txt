if i had not read pat barkers union street before seeing this film i would have liked it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my kind of film it is well made and in no way do i want to say otherwise but as an adaptation it fails from every angle the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england workingclass area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished i was put through tears repulsion shock anger sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of but i novel i simply couldnt put down depressing yes but utterly gripping the film oh dear hollywood took barkers truth and reality and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film an inspiring soundtrack excellent performances a tale of hope and romanceyes an adaptation of union streetno the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fondas character their stories are touched on but many are discarded i accept that some of barkers tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isnt practical but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain broken windows covered with cardboard and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine pretty houses and a twinkling williams score if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of reality i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like schindlers listbut without the happy ending

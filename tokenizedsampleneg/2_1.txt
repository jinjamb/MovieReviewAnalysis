i saw the capsule comment said great acting in my opinion these are two great actors giving horrible performances and with zero chemistry with one another for a great director in his alltime worst effort robert de niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time jane fondas performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character mostly because the character is so poorly written molasseslike would be too swift an adjective for this films excruciating pacing although the films intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy watching it is a true bummer i give it 1 out of 10 truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that i have ever seen

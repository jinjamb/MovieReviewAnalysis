all i could think of while watching this movie was bgrade slop many have spoken about its redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events yet really the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole as far as the plot is concerned it was lacklustre unimaginative implausible and convoluted you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action looks can only carry a film so far the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there and a final gunfight towards the end nothing really to write home about as others have said bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad you revel in that fact this film however is a void its nothing furthermore if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way requiem for a dream trainspotting fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go overall both serious and funny and halfbaked on a final note the one possibly redeeming line in this movie delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock stock and two smokling barrels to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vile overall i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie

this movie was terrible at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok so i watched it the acting was terrible it was like the actor were almost camera shy everything seemed fake i feel bad for edward furlong terminator 2 was my favorite a few years ago ive watched it at least 20 times the plot was also crap the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines on the plus side its the good kind of bad movie the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get so that later you can tell other people how you couldnt believe how terrible the movie was i think everybody should watch this so that then we could appreciate better other real movies

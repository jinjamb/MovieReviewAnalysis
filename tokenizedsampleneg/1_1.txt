robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so wasteful of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane fondas character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a snails pace is photographed in an illadvised manner and is insufferably preachy it also plugs in every cliche in the book swoozie kurtz is excellent in a supporting role but so what equally annoying is this new imdb rule of requiring ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesnt require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie

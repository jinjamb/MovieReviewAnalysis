there are lots of extremely goodlooking people in this movie thats probably the best thing about it perhaps that even makes it worth watching loaded tells the story of tristan price jesse metcalfe a young man whos about to make his mark on the world hes the son of a welltodo family with a good reputation and hes on his way to law school but like so many such settings things arent quite as perfect as they appear the expectations in this family far outweigh the love except for school tristans father rarely lets him leave the house this seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family which is partially revealed through flashbacks but isnt spelled out until the very end tristans claustrophobic environment causes him to let loose in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him out to a strip club to celebrate his graduation the celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party and from there tristan befriends sebastian cole corey large who pulls him into a drug dealing underworld while technically wellmade this movie suffers from a lackluster script and a storyline that isnt very engaging also counting against this film are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed annoying and outofplace such as slowmotion fastmotion freezeframes and echos these are the types of effects a director might normally utilize to show a characters perspective while on drugs except in this case they seem to have been sporadically tossed in at random points in some cheap attempt at style despite its cast of relative unknowns performances were good all around most notably with respect to the main antagonist corey large i suspect well be seeing at least a couple of these people in bigger and better projects in the future of course when mentioning the actors i must mention their looks rating based on hotness this movies scores an 11 the women in this movie are incrediblelooking and almost distract you from what a boring movie youre watching im sure the male characters are also quite attractive but youll have to ask someone else to comment on that overall i cant recommend this movie not for buying renting or even seeing for free its unfortunately just not worth the effort it takes to sit through

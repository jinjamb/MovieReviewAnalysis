terrible movie nuff said these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i dont know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are deniz akkayas breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and unneeded rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage ok now i am just going to rag on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this offal then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a friggen essay on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary

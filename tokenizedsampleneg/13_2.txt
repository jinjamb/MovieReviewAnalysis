weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer also one of the stars was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts its poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 20072008 note saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened

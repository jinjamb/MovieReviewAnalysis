if you look at corey larges information here on imdb apparently theres a movie called reload in production as of june 08 in which hes playing a character named sebastian cole first of all how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel and second didnt sebastian get killed at the end of loaded i watched this in the wee hours of the morning when i was battling insomnia and so i was drifting in and out while it was on im sure i missed some plot points but overall it seemed really weak larges performance was for me one of the stronger parts of the film im also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls since i thought the actress playing brooke was pretty but not exceptional

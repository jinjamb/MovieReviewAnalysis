i basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about to tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didnt make sense the only reason i watched this movie in the first place was to see chace crawford he is so hot but in this movie his hair was kind of weird but still hot however despite how hot chace is it really did not make up for the film i guess the plot isnt that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence is it that hard to express your anger without saying the f word every timethe cussing was annoying and the whole flashy camera shaking thing gave me a headache all in all although the plot was ok i found the film to be a bore and over dramatic thats why i only cut to scenes with chace in it lol anyways not worth renting unless your a diehard fan of a specific cast member like i was oh yeah the cast was hot the girls were hot but chace is the best

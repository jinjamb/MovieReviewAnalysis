i have to congratulate the genius who approved this one edward furlong youre not as good as you think mate you cant grab on every piece of lowcost amateur crap which sole intention has to be to get some bucks the filming is bad and i mean bad anyone with a camera would get the same result or better the acting lets just say dont go to the supermarket looking for actors the good ones usually come with a degree or at least have some damn experience the director mr jon keeyes please find your purpose in life as a director you simply suck your directing is poor the angles are all messed up not in a good way the lines seem as if theyre being read out of toilet paper and the damn music it always comes up when it shouldnt and goes out for no apparent reason and dont go for writer either by the way making movies isnt like serving on a coffeshop it requires art and skill things i really doubt youll ever have instead of making a badass shootout movie you shouldve shot this one back to oblivion and wait till something good came up or just go find a job on a coffeshop youll have less stress and youll save movie goers some money and a bad night vote 110 my first one

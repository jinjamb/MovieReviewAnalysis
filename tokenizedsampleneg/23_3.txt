i rented this one on dvd without any prior knowledge i was suspicious seeing michael madsen appearing in a movie i have never heard of but it was a freebie so why not check it out well my guess is that mr blonde would very much like to forget hes ever taken part in such a shame of a film apparently if your script and dialogs are terrible even good actors can not save the day not to mention the amateur actors that flood this film too many nonnativeenglishspeakers play parts of nativeenglishspeakers reading out lines from a script that should have been thrown away and not having been made into a movie its unbelievable how unbelievable all the lines in the movie sound the music is awful and totally out of place and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school play i recommend you watch it just so you would appreciate other better movies this is why i gave it a 3 instead of the 1 it deserves

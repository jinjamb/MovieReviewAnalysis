this film is terrible you dont really need to read this review further if you are planning on watching it suffice to say dont unless you are studying how not to make a good movie the acting is horrendous serious amateur hour throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen only to find out that it is actually him a new low even for him the plot is terrible people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before even by the standard of hollywood action flicks this is a terrible movie dont watch it go for a jog instead at least you wont feel like killing yourself

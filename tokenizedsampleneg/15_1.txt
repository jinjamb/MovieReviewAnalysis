this is it this is the one this is the worst movie ever made ever it beats everything i have never seen worse retire the trophy and give it to these peopletheres just no comparison even three days after watching this for some reason i still dont know why i can not believe how insanely horrific this movie iswas its so bad so far from anything that could be considered a movie a story or anything that should have ever been created and brought into our existence this made me question whether or not humans are truly put on this earth to do good it made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe this type of movie sincerely hurts us as a society we should be ashamed i really can not emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good its an embarrassment i dont know how on earth any of these actors writers or the director of this film sleeps at night knowing that they had a role in making loaded i dont know what type of disgusting monsters enjoy watching these types of movies that being said i love a good bad movie i love shark attack 3 i love bad taste they are hilarious i tell all my friends to see them because they are bad but thisthis crosses the line of bad into a whole new dimension this is awkward bad this is the bad where you know everything that is going to happen every line every action every death every sequence before they happen and not just like a second or two before i mean like after watching the first 5 minutes before every cheesy editing effect is shamelessly used over and over again to a sickening point i really never want to see the shaky camera drug buzz rush effect or jump cuts or swerve cuts or any fancy cut ever again ever this is meticulously boring repetitive and just tortures the audience butand let me be specific here the most disturbing thing about this movie is that given the production it appears that a somewhat decent amount of money was actually put into this excrement i personally will grab the shoulders of the director if i ever see him and shake him into submission demanding that he run home and swallow twogallons of draino or i will do it for him if we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture for our war prisoners abroad just keep showing them this movie in a padded cell over and over again trust me i think they will become more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time of sitting through this stop these movies they are just the most vile of all facets of our society please stop now

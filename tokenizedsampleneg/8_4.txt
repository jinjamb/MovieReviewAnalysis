610 acting not great but some good acting 410 director makes some stupid decisions for this film 210 writer story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws 410 overall score for this movie dont waste your time with this film its not worth it i gave 4 for this movie and it may be too much characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens storywise not in good way because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after 30 minutes too many special effects slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards its always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but theres too many tracks in this one in the first hour there is almost 5050 dialogs and musics

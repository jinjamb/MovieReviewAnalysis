assuming this wont end up a straighttovideo release i would have to say void this title at all costs unless youre bored of good wellexecuted movies that is i saw this last night at afi dallas and i left with 20 minutes remaining simply because i didnt care anymore about the plot not about insulting the directorthat is awkward when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie a shot out shattered window before any shots are firedand then the window breaks with the first shot things are going to bad lets just say this is only an indicator of things to comeunfortunately ill spare you all the details but this is subpar in every manner even the halfassed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when youre expecting halfassed acting from him and the rape scenechrist shut up and take it should never be used in a rape scene ever 310

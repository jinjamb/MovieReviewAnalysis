sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that well endure this many clichã©s and still be entertained of course it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun cant do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more malicious than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someones face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens its a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these components from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes ill say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice theyve done to us all
